## Phippy Goes Fact-Finding

Captain Kube teaches Phippy the fundamentals of tri-temporal database modeling through a journalism exercise. Zee reflects on favorite books over time, including new favorites discovered during "Book Week".

Join them on their adventure as they collect facts and try to discover each of the three dimensions of journalistic time.

## Cross-walk of temporal terminology

Below is my current understanding of the interrelationships between concepts. Please reach out if you notice anything incorrect: doug.beatty@gmail.com

The biggest question is where the *epistemological time period* fits in.
